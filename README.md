# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio-Projects! This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects that I have worked on. 
Each project explores various datasets, applies analytical techniques, and derives meaningful insights.

## Project Overview
In this repository, you'll find a compilation of data analysis projects covering a diverse range of topics and industries. 
Each project is designed to demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, data modeling, data visualization, exploration and interpretation. 
The projects are presented in SQL file, Jupyter Notebooks, and PDF, providing a detailed walkthrough of the analysis.

### PROJECT 1: Covid 19 - SQL Data Exploration

1. Implemented SQL data exploration efforts for COVID-19 deaths and Conducted in-depth data exploration of COVID-19 datasets
    using SQL queries, uncovering trends, patterns, and anomalies.
2. Applied advanced SQL functions to aggregate, filter, and analyze data, providing valuable insights into the spread
   and impact of the virus.
3. Applied strong SQL skills to perform data cleansing and validation procedures, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of
   COVID-19 mortality data, and played a pivotal role in maintaining data integrity throughout the exploration process.
- Database: Microsoft SQL server.

### PROJECT 2: Nashville Housing - SQL Data Cleaning

1. Implemented robust data cleaning procedures for Nashville housing data, ensuring accuracy and uniformity for subsequent analyses.
   Developed & executed validation checks, resolved missing values & standardized formats to enhance the data quality.
2. Performed data cleaning by using aggregate functions & advanced SQL such as joins, CTEs, rank functions, etc. Resulting
   in a cleaned dataset that formed the basis for a comprehensive insights into the Nashville housing market.
- Database: Microsoft SQL server

### PROJECT 3: Hotel Booking Cancellation

1. Led a Python project focused on hotel booking cancellations, developing and implementing predictive models to analyze reservation 
   status in different hotels and anticipate potential cancellations, resulting in a more effective approach to managing reservations.
2. Aggregated and visualized the data by using pandas, numpy and matplotlib in Jupyter notebook.

Insights generated:
1. Booking Cancelations are more frequent in city hotels as compared to resort hotels.
2. Reservations canceled were highest in January while August had most bookings not canceled.
3. Portugal tops the list of countries with the highest number of canceled reservations at 70.07%
- IDE : Jupyter Notebook

### PROJECT 4: Sales Insights

1. Developed and maintained interactive dashboards and reports, providing real-time visibility into sales performance metrics for key stakeholders.
2. Applied statistical methods and data visualization techniques to translate raw data into actionable business recommendations,
   contributing to a 5% improvement in overall business performance.
- Tool: Power BI

### PROJECT 5: HR Analytics

1. Created a dashboard to visualize and analyze data, resulting in a 20% increase in data accessibility and improved decision-making process.
2. In addition, I performed data transformation using Power Query and processed employee data through DAX and Excel to ensure data completeness and validity.
- Tool: Power BI
  
### PROJECT 6: Pizza Sales - (SQL + Power BI)

1. Transformed and filtered pizza sales data using various aggregate and filtering functions to analyze the key performance indicators (KPIs).
2. Connected Power Bi with Microsoft SQL server to import data records, and then created & implemented a database of pizza sales.
   I carefully reviewed the data to assess the sales trends, including size, percentage of sales by pizza category, and daily & weekly trends.
3. Furthermore, I developed interactive and dynamic dashboards using Power BI to visualize and analyze data, making it
   easier to interpret and present the findings in a user-friendly manner.
- Tools: Microsoft SQL server, Power BI
